This was a presentation given to the current Ph.D and Masters students at Rutgers University as part of a series of 
talks titled SSPAR(Student Seminars in Physics and Astronomy at Rutgers.) What can be determined 
about a complex landscape or network by moving through it in the most unintelligent way? This talk covered an 
answer to this question by presenting a formalism which combines Bayes' theorem with random walk theory with 
applications given in the worlds of computer science and epidemiology.
