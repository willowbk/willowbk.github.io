This was a presentation given to the current Ph.D and Masters students at Rutgers University as part of a series of talks titled SSPAR (Student Seminars in Physics and Astronomy at Rutgers.) The presentation covered the early stages of a biophysical / population genetics model designed for the careful investigation of the codon usage bias.
