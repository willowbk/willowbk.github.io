Complex networks can be found throughout the physical sciences. This poster covers a new formalism for acquiring the 
global properties of complex networks via random walk sampling. This methodology only requires a very small portion 
of the full network to be sampled, and is general to all weighted, undirected networks. More detail and application
of this topic can be found [here](http://willowbk.github.io/files/RapidBayesianInferenceofGlobalNetworkStatisticsUsingRandomWalks.pdf).
