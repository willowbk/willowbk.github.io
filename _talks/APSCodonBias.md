This presentation covered a biophysical / population genetics model designed for the careful investigation of the codon usage bias. The model presented incorporates modern theories on the origins of the codon bias in a bare-minimum-for-accurate-prediction approach which develops a heirarchy of model complexities until the bias is captured.
