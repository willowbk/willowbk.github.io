During my time at Rutgers University, I have been teaching both recitation and lab sections for the Spring, Summer and Fall sessions for all but two semesters of my graduate career. Through this experience, I have had the opportunity to teach a great variety topics in classical mechanics, electromagnetism, optics, quantum mechanics, nuclear physics, special relativity, and medical physics.
