During my time at Rutgers University, I have been teaching both recitation and lab sections for the Spring, Summer and Fall sessions for all but two semesters of my graduate career. Through this experience, I have had the opportunity to teach a great variety topics in classical mechanics, electromagnetism, optics, quantum mechanics, nuclear physics, special relativity, and medical physics. I have found teaching, mentoring, and tutoring to be an especially rewarding experience which has allowed me to connect with literally hundreds of people, most of whom are just beginning their professional careers. Being a part of the lives of so many has already been a rewarding experience, and will likely continue to be so in years to come!
