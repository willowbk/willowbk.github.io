title: "Electron Shell Ionization of Atoms with Classical, Relativistic Scattering"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/ElectronShellIonization
excerpt: 'Forward scattering of ionization from noble gases in ultrahigh intensities of 2×1019 W/cm2 is investigated. The observed strongly forward scattered photoionization is in agreement with classical field scattering employing the full nonparaxial laser field.'

My contribution to this research project consisted of operating and maintaining the high-intensity laser system, as well as data acquisition, in Prof. Barry Walker's lab at the University of Delaware. A full description of the laser system can be found [here](https://sites.udel.edu/bcwalker/research/).
