title: "Dual RNA-seq provides insight into the biology of the neglected intracellular human pathogen
Orientia tsutsugamushi"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/DualRNAseq
excerpt: 'Emerging and neglected diseases pose challenges as their biology is frequently poorly understood, and genetic tools often do not exist to manipulate the responsible pathogen. Organism agnostic sequencing technologies offer a promising approach to understand the molecular processes underlying these diseases.'

The bacteria Orientia tsutsugamushi has been well-characterized by the work of Salje et al. In this paper, I provided an analysis of the codon content of various groups of genes within the genome of O. tsutsugamushi, and demonstrated the lack of optimality for translation speed.
