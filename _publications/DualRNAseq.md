Orientia tsutsugamushi"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/DualRNAseq
excerpt: 'The bacteria species Orientia tsutsugamushi has been well-characterized by the work of Salje et al. In this paper, I provided an analysis of the codon content of various groups of genes within the genome of O. tsutsugamushi, and demonstrated the lack of optimality for translation speed in this species compared to other well understand bacteria.'

The bacteria species Orientia tsutsugamushi has been well-characterized by the work of Salje et al. In this paper, I provided an analysis of the codon content of various groups of genes within the genome of O. tsutsugamushi, and demonstrated the lack of optimality for translation speed in this species compared to other well understand bacteria.
