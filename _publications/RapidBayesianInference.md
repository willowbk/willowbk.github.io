This paper introduces a novel methodology for network statistics acquisition via random walk sampling. The theoretical background is developed, and the methodology is applied to several realistic examples. These include the network formed by hyperlinks between Wikipedia pages, walked by Python implemented [Internet bots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_bot), and a [dynamical epidemiological simulation](http://www.pnas.org/content/106/40/16897) on a network developed using a [hidden metric](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.100.078701).
